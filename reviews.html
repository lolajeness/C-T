      My son Bill really likes it here, everyday he comes home and tells me
      about how much fun they had, and what the students learned that day.

      From what my daughter has told me, the head teacher is a very interesting
      person who "wears funny clothes and likes to have fun". the teachers also
      show the kids basic facts in very imaginative ways, like they made kites,
      and used that to show the kids how powerful the wind is. Very happy my
      little girl is going here, 10/10.
